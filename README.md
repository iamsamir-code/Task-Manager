Task Manager
I have made a very simple but effective project to manage your daily tasks. In today’s world full of distraction, it is really important to manage your day by managing your tasks. I have made this project to make your day more productive and efficient.

Working and Logic:
1)	I started by creating an empty list called tasks to store all the data.
2)	The program first asks for the number of starting tasks and runs a loop to add them to the list immediately.
3)	I used a while True loop for the main menu so the program keeps running and doesn't close after just one step.
4)	When "Add" is selected, the code takes the input and simply appends it to the end of the list.
5)	For "Update," I added a check to see if the task exists first. If it does, I find its index and replace the old name with the new one.
6)	The "Delete" option also checks if the task exists, then finds the index and removes it using the del keyword.
7)	Choosing "View" just prints the current list so I can see all pending tasks.
8)	Option 5 is the exit command, which uses a break statement to stop the loop and close the program.
Technologies used:
1)	Python 3
2)	VS Code
3)	Command Line Interface (CLI)
How to run the program?
1)	 Install python 3
2)	Open terminal 
3)	Run the code
4)	Enter the number of tasks you want to add 
5)	Input your tasks
6)	Enter 5 if want to exit
